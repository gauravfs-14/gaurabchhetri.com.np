**Measles Dashboard** is a focused public health tool that helps analysts and community stakeholders answer three questions quickly: **where are cases rising**, **who is under-protected**, and **how are trends shifting over time**. I built it to turn scattered updates into a clear, trusted picture for West Texas.

## Highlights

- **Interactive map** with county level case counts and vaccination signals  
- **Trend views** for recent activity and historical comparisons  
- **Coverage insights** that highlight low vaccination pockets  
- **Fast, mobile friendly UI** optimized for quick triage and public communication

> Live site: **https://measles-dashboard.vercel.app/**

## What it shows

- **Cases**: rolling counts and week over week change  
- **Vaccination**: coverage bands and gaps by county or age group when available  
- **Context**: seasonal patterns and recent alerts summarized into readable cards

Data source: Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS TX). See current alerts at

## Tech Overview

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript  
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
- **Charts**: Recharts  
- **State**: React Context for filters and selections  
- **Hosting**: Vercel

Design choices focus on a small dependency footprint, smooth interactions on low power devices, and clear color and typography defaults for accessibility.

## Interaction Model

- **Filter** by county or region  
- **Hover or tap** to reveal case counts and vaccination context  
- **Compare** time windows to spot acceleration or slowdown  
- **Share** direct links to a selected view

These interactions keep the flow simple for non technical users while still supporting deeper exploration.

## Data Flow

1. **Ingest** official updates and reports from DSHS TX  
2. **Normalize** and store as lightweight JSON for the web app  
3. **Render** maps and charts from a single typed data layer

Planned additions include automatic refresh hooks and provenance notes per update.

## Impact

- Faster situational awareness for communities and campus stakeholders  
- Clear communication of where coverage lags  
- Modular codebase that can be reused for other communicable disease trackers
