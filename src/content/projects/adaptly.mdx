**Adaptly** is an AI-adaptive UI library for React and Next.js that brings intelligence to modern web dashboards. Built during HackTX 2025 at The University of Texas at Austin, it's a TypeScript-first library that lets your UI understand what users mean, not just what they click.

Most "AI UI" tools stop at code generation. Adaptly doesn't generate code — it uses your code intelligently. The library dynamically mounts, unmounts, and arranges your existing React components to create context-aware interfaces in real time.

## What It Does

- **Adaptive Runtime Layer**: Acts as an intelligent runtime that reasons about structure, hierarchy, and intent
- **Natural Language Interface**: Users press `Cmd + K` and describe what they want in plain English
- **Component Intelligence**: Dynamically arranges your existing React components based on user intent
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Works with OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini models
- **Persistent Storage**: UI state is automatically saved and restored across sessions
- **TypeScript-First**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support throughout

Instead of navigating menus or switching dashboards, users just tell the interface what they want — and the LLM rewrites the layout in real time using your existing components.

## Technical Stack

Built with **Next.js 15**, **React 19+**, **TypeScript 5.9+**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**. Adaptly uses AI SDK integrations for multiple LLM providers and includes a component registry system (`adaptly.json`) that lets the AI understand your component capabilities.

## Why We Built It

Adaptly was born from a hackathon weekend at UT Austin. We wanted to create something that goes beyond code generation — a tool that makes existing UIs truly adaptive and intent-driven. The goal was to build an AI that lives inside your app's design system, not as a chat overlay.

Most dashboard builders require users to click through multiple menus. Adaptly turns that into a conversation: "Show me sales and analytics" → the UI adapts instantly.

## Impact

Built in 48 hours during HackTX 2025[^1], Adaptly is now open source and available on npm. It represents our vision for AI-assisted front-end development, where design intent and runtime reasoning work together seamlessly.

The library is production-ready and can be integrated into any React or Next.js application with a single command:

```bash
npm install adaptly
```
