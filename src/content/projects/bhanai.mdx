**Bhanai** began as a passion project during my exploration of language design and compiler concepts. Inspired by Bhai Lang [^1], I wondered: *what if programming felt closer to home, using the words we speak every day?* That question became the seed for Bhanai.

At its core, Bhanai is a **simple and intuitive programming language** with Nepali-inspired syntax. Instead of `let` or `const`, you write `rakha` (to keep) and `sadai_rakha` (to always keep). Instead of `if`, you write `yadi` (if). To print output, you use `bhanai` (to speak). These cultural touches transform programming into something more familiar and engaging.

Built on **Node.js**, Bhanai supports the essentials:  
- Variables and constants  
- Arithmetic and logical operations  
- Strings, arrays, and objects  
- Conditional statements and loops  
- Console input and output  

You write code in a `.bhn` file and run it with the `chalau` command, making the experience both playful and practical.  

### Example Program

```bhn
tippani This is a sample code for the Bhanai Programming Language

rakha("name", "Bhanai User")
sadai_rakha("PI", 3.14159)

rakha("sum", jod(10, 20))
bhanai("Hello, " + name + "! Sum of 10 and 20 is: " + sum)

# String manipulation
rakha("greeting", "Namaste")
rakha("fullGreeting", jodString(greeting, " Swagat chha Bhanai ma!"))
bhanai("Full Greeting: " + fullGreeting)

yadi age < 18:
    bhanai("Timro umar kam chha.")
athawa age == 18:
    bhanai("Timro umar 18 chha.")
aru:
    bhanai("Timro umar thik chha.")
```

## Why It Matters

Bhanai is not about replacing existing languages, it‚Äôs about showing how code can carry culture. For programmers in Nepal, it a playful activity to write in the langugage they understand. For me, it was an opportunity to dive deep into how interpreters and execution environments work, and to build something end-to-end that reflects both engineering and identity.

The language currently supports only basic constructs, but I plan to expand it over time. Every new feature is not just an upgrade to Bhanai, but also a way for me to learn more about language design and compilers.

## Resources 

I used plenty of online resources while learning to build something like this. I am listing out a few for y'all, if you also wanted to learn building a programming language actually works.
