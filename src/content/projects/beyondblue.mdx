**_Beyond Blue_** is an **AI-powered platform** that brings space exploration to everyone. Built during _RiverHacks 2025_, it lets users explore NASA’s exoplanet catalog[^1] through a sleek, social media-style interface enriched with **AI-generated summaries** and planet stories.

Instead of browsing spreadsheets of astrophysical data, users can experience each planet as a living narrative, complete with discovery context, classification, and AI insights.

## 🚀 Inspiration

The idea for Beyond Blue started with a simple question:  
_“What if discovering exoplanets felt as intuitive and engaging as scrolling a feed?”_

Exoplanet datasets are fascinating but inaccessible to most people. Our goal was to **humanize scientific data** using storytelling, AI, and thoughtful design, making astronomy exploration interactive and fun.

## 🪐 Highlights

- **AI Summaries:** Automatically generated planet descriptions and narratives.
- **Smart Filters:** Search by discovery method, distance, size, and year.
- **Interactive Feed:** Explore planets like browsing cosmic posts.
- **ML Classifier:** Predicts whether a candidate is a real exoplanet using observational data.

## 🌠 The RiverHacks Journey

We built Beyond Blue in **24 hours**; from brainstorming to deployment. Each team member took on key roles across data processing, model training, and frontend design.

Despite sleepless coding sessions, we built a working prototype that blended **machine learning, storytelling, and user experience** into one cohesive platform.

🏅 **Winner – Bold Innovation in Search & AI Track**  
Awarded **$1,000** for advancing AI-powered data exploration.
