## Key Features

- **Lab Test Interpretation**: Upload PDFs of blood work or diagnostics and receive AI-generated insights
- **Medication Guidance**: Explain prescriptions like ‚ÄúMetformin 500mg BID‚Äù in plain language
- **Document Memory**: Persistent recall of past documents for continuity across sessions
- **Privacy-First**: Local vector storage and offline-capable AI workflows

## Why It Matters

Healthcare data is often overwhelming and inaccessible. From cryptic lab values to confusing prescription shorthand, patients are left in the dark. MedGuide AI bridges this gap by combining **agentic reasoning** with **retrieval and context-awareness**, giving users safe, clear, and trustworthy explanations of their own health records.

## Team

Built with an amazing team of collaborators: **Samar Ranjit [^1], Diwas Pandit [^2], Sujal Pandey [^3]**, and mentorship from the **AITX community**.
