**CognitiveSky** is a research platform and interactive dashboard for exploring mental health narratives on the **Bluesky decentralized social network**.  
It was built to answer an important question: *how can we track and understand large-scale discussions on mental health in real time?*

Inspired by TwiXplorer [^1], CognitiveSky integrates **streaming data ingestion**, **state-of-the-art NLP labeling**, and **interactive visualization** into a single open-source framework. It has been **accepted for presentation at HICSS 2026**, highlighting its contribution to computational social science and mental health research.

## Highlights

- **Real-time ingestion** of public mental-health-related posts via the Bluesky Firehose API.  
- **Automated NLP pipelines** for sentiment, emotion, and topic detection using pre-trained transformer models.  
- **Daily reproducible snapshots** stored in Turso (libSQL) and exported as JSON for transparency and reuse.  
- **Interactive Next.js dashboard** for exploring narratives, topics, hashtags, and engagement trends.  
- **Fully open-source** with reproducible pipelines, making it accessible to researchers and developers.

## System Overview

CognitiveSky is powered by two main components:

### 1. **`mh_worker` (Data Ingestion)**  
- Node.js worker running 24/7 on Oracle Cloud free-tier VM  
- Streams Bluesky posts using the Firehose API  
- Filters for mental health keywords and stores posts in Supabase  

### 2. **`summary.py` (Labeling & Summarization)**  
- Python-based NLP pipeline triggered daily via GitHub Actions  
- Performs:
  - Sentiment analysis (`cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment`)  
  - Emotion detection (`j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base`)  
  - Topic modeling (TF-IDF + NMF)  
- Migrates labeled data to Turso DB  
- Generates JSON summaries (`sentiments.json`, `emotions.json`, `topics.json`, `hashtags.json`, etc.)  

These summaries power the interactive dashboard and allow temporal analysis of narratives.

## Dashboard

The dashboard is built with **Next.js + Tailwind + Recharts** and provides:  
- **Topic timelines:** How sentiment/emotion shifts across major discussions  
- **Hashtag & emoji analysis:** Cultural and emotional signals in conversations  
- **Engagement insights:** Most active users, posts, and community trends  
- **Narrative evolution:** Tracking shifts in discourse over days and weeks  

## Impact

CognitiveSky demonstrates how **AI, decentralized platforms, and open data** can come together to support research in public health and online discourse. Its contributions include:  

- A **scalable, reproducible framework** for analyzing social narratives  
- A working example of **24/7 ingestion + NLP labeling + visualization**  
- A tool that researchers and advocates can extend to other domains beyond mental health  

By combining technical rigor with accessibility, CognitiveSky bridges the gap between **raw social media data** and **actionable insights**.
