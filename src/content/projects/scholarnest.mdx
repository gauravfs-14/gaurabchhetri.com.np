**ScholarNest** is a modern publishing platform for academic work. It was born from a simple question: *why should sharing a research paper online feel clunky, outdated, or inaccessible?*  

I built ScholarNest to give individuals, labs, and research groups a way to publish their papers, datasets, and tools with **beautiful typography, interactive MDX components, and clean organization**, all in one open-source platform.

## Features

- 📝 **MDX-based authoring** with full academic metadata (title, authors, DOI, BibTeX, datasets, tools, etc.)  
- 📂 **Folder-aware organization** so research groups can structure projects as they like  
- 🎓 **Author & affiliation display** with support for highlighting corresponding authors  
- 📄 **Academic sections** including abstracts, acknowledgements, and citations  
- 🧩 **Custom MDX components** like `<MDXImage>` and `<MDXAccordion>` for interactive figures and explanations  
- 📦 **Responsive design** with prose-style typography for a journal-like reading experience  
- ⚡ **Next.js + Contentlayer + shadcn/ui** foundation for performance and extensibility  

## Why It Matters

For most researchers, publishing online means static PDFs, fragmented websites, or institutional repositories that feel dated. ScholarNest changes that by making **academic content as engaging and interactive as the modern web**.  

Whether you’re an individual scholar, a student group, or a research lab, ScholarNest makes it easy to:  
- Showcase your papers with proper metadata and citations  
- Embed figures, datasets, and interactive components directly in the text  
- Maintain a professional yet accessible research hub  

## How It Works

1. Write your paper in **MDX** with metadata fields (title, authors, DOI, etc.)  
2. Drop it into the `src/papers/` directory  
3. ScholarNest automatically renders it into a styled research page with sidebar navigation, responsive layout, and interactive figures  

The result is a **modern academic publishing workflow** - version-controlled, open-source, and easy to deploy on Vercel or your own server.
