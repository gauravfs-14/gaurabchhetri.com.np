When I started programming back in 2020, I thought building things was mostly about showing what you *can* do, proving that you know a language, a framework, or a library. Over time, I realized that this mindset often leads to projects that check a technical box but don’t really matter to anyone.

That’s where my mantra comes in:
**“Do what you want, not what you can.”**

Instead of asking *what can I build with this tech?*, I ask *what do I want to create that excites me, helps people, or solves a real problem?* That shift has shaped everything I’ve built since.

## From Experiments to Purpose

* **Bhanai (2024)** [^1]: I could have just practiced Node.js by building another web app, but I *wanted* to explore how programming languages could reflect culture. That’s why I built Bhanai, a simple language with Nepali-inspired syntax. It wasn’t just a coding exercise — it was about identity and creativity.

* **CognitiveSky (2025)** [^2]: I could have just fine-tuned a sentiment model as a portfolio project, but I *wanted* to understand mental health narratives on social media. That’s how CognitiveSky was born: a full pipeline, from Bluesky Firehose ingestion to sentiment/emotion/topic dashboards, with a mission to support researchers and advocates.

* **MedGuide AI (Hackathon, 2025)** [^3]: We *could* have built any demo-worthy app, but we *wanted* to tackle a problem that touches everyone, making medical reports less intimidating. The result was an AI agent that explains labs and prescriptions in plain language, which ended up winning a hackathon.

* **ResQMe (Hackathon, 2025)** [^4] : Similarly, instead of chasing flashy features, we *wanted* to build something for public safety. ResQMe became an AI-powered SOS and triage system, winning SerpApi’s Community Engagement Track.

## Why This Matters

When you build what you *want* (not just what you *can*):

* You stay motivated long after the “tutorial high” wears off.
* Your projects reflect your values and passions, not just your skills.
* People connect more with your work, because they can see the story behind it.

## The Bigger Picture

This mantra doesn’t mean ignoring technical learning. In fact, pushing myself toward *want*-driven projects forced me to learn more than I would have otherwise. From LangGraph agents to real-time dashboards to building my own language, the skills came naturally because the *why* was strong.

As I continue my journey; through hackathons, research, and open source; this simple reminder guides me:

**Don’t just prove what you can do. Create what you truly want to exist.**
