**ComputeNepal** is my long-running tech blog and open-source learning hub.  
What started in 2020 as a small attempt to document my programming journey has grown into a platform with **200+ articles**, tutorials, and projects, reaching thousands of readers who want to learn about software development, AI, and emerging technologies.

## Highlights

## Motivation

When I started learning programming, I realized how many resources were either paywalled or too advanced for beginners in Nepal. ComputeNepal was my way of filling that gap, creating **accessible, beginner-friendly, and practical tutorials** that could help anyone take their first steps in tech.

Over time, the blog has evolved from simple coding posts into a **knowledge hub** with open-source projects, research write-ups, and experimentations in AI and web development.

## Impact

- Helped **thousands of readers** from Nepal and abroad get started with programming and AI concepts  
- Sparked collaborations and feedback from students, developers, and educators  
- Became the foundation for several of my later research and open-source initiatives

## Acknowledgements
