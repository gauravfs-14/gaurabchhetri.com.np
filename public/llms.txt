# Gaurab Chhetri — Portfolio & Dev Logs

> Engineer and builder focused on practical web, data, and ML projects. I like shipping useful tools, writing concise explainers, and keeping things simple. This file gives LLMs a high‑signal map of my site.

I publish project write‑ups, lightweight dev logs, and small utilities. The site uses Next.js (App Router) with content in MDX. Links below point to the most relevant entry points and representative work.
